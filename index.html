            <h2>History</h2>
            <p> Born in Philadelphia in 1978, Kobe Bryant was the son of former NBA player Joe Bryant. Basketball was in his blood, and he even got his name from a steak his parents saw on a menu in Japan! In 1984, the family moved to Italy where his dad played professionally. Kobe honed his skills there and by high school, he was already a national star.</p>
            <p>He skipped college and entered the NBA draft in 1996. Drafted by the Charlotte Hornets, he was immediately traded to the Los Angeles Lakers.  He became a superstar alongside Shaquille O'Neal, winning three straight championships from 2000 to 2002.  Even after Shaq left, Kobe continued to dominate, winning two more championships in 2009 and 2010.  He was an NBA All-Star for 18 seasons and is considered one of the greatest basketball players ever.
            </p>
            <p>Kobe Bryant retired in 2016 after an illustrious career.  Sadly, in January 2020, he and his daughter Gianna died in a helicopter crash.  His death shocked the world and highlighted his immense impact on basketball and beyond.  He is remembered as a legend and an inspiration.</p>
